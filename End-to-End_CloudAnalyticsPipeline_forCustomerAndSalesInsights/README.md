# **End-to-End Cloud Analytics Pipeline for Customer and Sales Insights** #
## **Project Overview** ##
This project delivers a modern cloud analytics solution to meet a key business requirement for data-driven decision-making. It involves designing and implementing an end-to-end data pipeline on Azure that ingests customer and sales data from an on-premises SQL database, processes and transforms the data in the cloud, and presents meaningful insights through interactive Power BI dashboards.

The reporting layer focuses on critical business metrics such as gender-based customer distribution and sales performance across product categories. Users can dynamically explore the data using filters for date ranges, product categories, and gender, enabling deeper analysis and informed strategic decisions.

## **Technology Stack:** ##
On-Premises SQL Database, Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, Power BI, Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory), Azure Key Vault
